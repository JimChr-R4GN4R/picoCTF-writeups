# Description:
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table.txt to solve it?.
(table.txt = vigenere table)
# Hints:

- Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{HELLO}' as the flag.
- Please use all caps for the message.

# Journey

From the table I wanted to try if it's vigenere cipher. So I found a good script and found the flag!

<code>python3 script.py</code>

Flag: PICOCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}
