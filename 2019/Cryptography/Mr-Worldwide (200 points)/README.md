We see in text file that it has coordinates.So I thinked at first that I will put the first letter of every country the cord is,but didn't work. So after that tried the first letter of the city these cords are.
I made a script to do the work fast.
So let's try it!

<code>python3 script.py</code> (it needs reverse_geocoder module.If you do not have it,then it will install it for you.
If something goes wrong,then try in your terminal type <code>pip3 install reverse_geocoder</code> and then run the script).
